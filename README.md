With the increasing number of specimens being stored inside Ultra-Low Biofreezers, the Biological and Physical Sciences Department of the West Visayas State University needs a systematic and reliable way of monitoring inventory and the fluctuation of the temperature inside the biofreezer.

This study generally aims to develop an IoT Inventory Management System based on emerging technology to manage the biospecimen in an Ultra-low Biofreezer.

* Develop a Biospecimens Inventory Management Mobile Application integrated with QR code Technology for an inventory of biospecimens inside Ultra-Low Biofreezers and real-time temperature monitoring.
* Develop an IoT device using ESP8266 Node MCU that will be able to continuously send temperature data to Biospecimens Inventory Management Mobile Application.
* Integrate a User Notification System using MQTT Framework and SMS Technology for user notification in an event of sudden temperature fluctuations in Ultra-Low Biofreezers.
* Implement and test the IoT Inventory Management System, and finally evaluate based on usability and effectiveness using ISO-standard Usability Evaluation Tools.

**Each one of the objectives were successfully tackled, and given solutions**
